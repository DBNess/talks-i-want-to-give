# Talks I Want To Give

**Please fork so people can see the great talks _you_ want to give, too!**

## What is this?

It's a list of possible talk ideas that maybe I'd like to give. It's half thinking out loud, and half soliciting feedback and suggestions. 

Publishing your talk ideas has a bunch of awesome benefits! 

- Sometimes you have brilliant ideas. Sometimes there are open CFP's. How often do they overlap? (for me: never)
- Conference organizers can find you through the list of forks and ask them to speak at your conference! 
- If someone wants you as a speaker, they can ask you to speak about a topic you actually like! 
- Sometimes it's hard to see what parts of your own work would make really good talks. Ask your friends and coworkers to write Issues and Pull Requests for awesome talk ideas!

## What do I do with it?

- Jot down your talk ideas as they come up. Never scratch your head at a CFP again!
- Host a brainstorming workshop where people write their own Talks I Want To Give.
- Use Issues, Pull Requests, or plain ol' email to suggest topics to your friends and mentees. Pro tip: even a small invitation goes a long way, particularly for women! 


## My Talk Ideas


### How to make your future data team hate you

Most companies are so busy getting their product and team set up that they don't think to get business logging audited. Fast forward a year or two when they can slow down and hire a data scientist: logs are missing! Critical info isn't logged, so joins are impossible! Years of insight, down the drain, all for lack of a few days work and the data know-how up front. Learn the most common mistakes made and how to prevent them. Bonus: you can use this work to show prospective data hires that you have your data shit together. 

(data science, data engineering, startups, hiring)

### Command line tools for data scientists

Hadoop is great for handling large amounts of data quickly, but what about your first few minutes with a data set? I'll talk about a few tools that will help you quickly get a handle on data files to get intuition for the data set, and make sure everything's there, and do it all right from the command line. 

(data science, unix, bash, sed, awk, eda, cli)

### Creating culture

"Culture" does not mean ping-pong tables. "Culture fit" does not mean "would be my friend." It can be hard to see your culture when you're embedded in itâ€”learn how to see your company's culture objectively and get concrete tips for influencing it it to hire more effectively and shape your company's trajectory.

(culture, hiring, leadership, startups)

### Maximizing Impact/LOC

Software doesn't necessarily have to be extensive or beautiful to be impactful. Two case studies of minimal code having a big effect on community. 

(software architecture)

### How I got 100 people to my first meetup (and kept them coming back)

Lessons learned from launching [a community](http://womenwhocode.com) from scratch. Would be a much more polished & thoughtful version of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_hQV6fiJD0).

(culture, startups)

### Other less-fleshed-out ideas: 

- Data cleaning with pipelines (Mario clip art)
- Why that 'algorithmic complexity' you read about on Coursera really matters
- How being a teacher was amazing preparation for my tech career. 
- Choosing the right hammer (some thoughts on picking the right tool for the job making your life a lot easier)
- Don't hire opinionated developers. Why [37signals](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2628-how-to-hire-a-programmer-when-youre-not-a-programmer) is wrong. 
- Transitioning into the tech industry/a new career (I get asked this a lot)


## Feedback please!

Ideas, suggestion, and honest feedback encouraged. I want to hear which of these ideas resonate, and ideas for making the others better. New ideas particularly welcome. Thanks!
