# Talks I Want To Give

## What is this?

A list of talk ideas for your future self. Never come up blank at a conference call for proposals again! 

It's a list of possible talk ideas that maybe you'd like to give. It's half thinking out loud, and half soliciting [30% feedback](http://blog.42floors.com/thirty-percent-feedback/) and suggestions. 

Publishing your talk ideas has a bunch of awesome benefits! 

- Sometimes you have brilliant ideas. Sometimes there are open CFP's. How often do they overlap? Never! Write 'em down now!
- If someone wants you as a speaker, they can ask you to speak about a topic you actually like! 
- Sometimes it's hard to see what parts of your own work would make really good talks. Ask your friends and coworkers to write Issues and Pull Requests for awesome talk ideas!

## What do I do with it?

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/sursh/talks-i-want-to-give)! `git clone git@github.com:sursh/talks-i-want-to-give.git` 
2. Write down some ideas of your own!
2. Send me a pull request to add your name to the list of talkers below! 
4. Bonus: host a workshop where people write their own talks-i-want-to-give!
