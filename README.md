# Talks I Want To Give

**Please fork so people can see the great talks _you_ want to give, too!**

## What is this?

It's a list of possible talk ideas that maybe I'd like to give. It's half thinking out loud, and half soliciting feedback and suggestions. 

Publishing your talk ideas has a bunch of awesome benefits! 

- Sometimes you have brilliant ideas. Sometimes there are open CFP's. How often do they overlap? (for me: never)
- Conference organizers can find you through the list of forks and ask them to speak at your conference! 
- If someone wants you as a speaker, they can ask you to speak about a topic you actually like! 
- Sometimes it's hard to see what parts of your own work would make really good talks. Ask your friends and coworkers to write Issues and Pull Requests for awesome talk ideas!

## What do I do with it?

- Jot down your talk ideas as they come up. Never scratch your head at a CFP again!
- Host a brainstorming workshop where people write their own Talks I Want To Give.
- Use Issues, Pull Requests, or plain ol' email to suggest topics to your friends and mentees. Pro tip: even a small invitation goes a long way, particularly for women!
